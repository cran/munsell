Version 0.4
==============================================================================

* fixed plotting functions to work with new themeing system in ggplot2 0.9.2

Version 0.3
==============================================================================

* put lookup code data in the right place to avoid namespace problems.

Version 0.2
==============================================================================

* added a NAMESPACE and removed package dependencies - colorspace is now
  imported, and ggplot2 is only a suggestion - you don't need it if you're
  using munsell only for colour choice, not for visualising the space.
